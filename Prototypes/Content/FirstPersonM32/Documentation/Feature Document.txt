Essence statement
The absence of a multi round grenade launcher in squad presents an opportunity for me to create a technical demonstration that can be adapted into a feature during my onboarding to the company. 
to fill this absence, I'm going to create a M32 grenade launcher using blueprint. The gun will fire using realworld measurements converted to Unreal unitys. The player will be able to swap between
four types of rounds each of which will provide different challenges and benefits.


design pillars
-This M32 launcher will include a variery of rounds to shoot
-The parameters will follow the conventions of previously established grenade launchers in squad
-The real life properties, design features, and limitations of the weapon will be represented
